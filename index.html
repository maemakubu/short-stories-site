      <p>The Great Beyond

When Eli took his last breath, he expected silence. Instead, he heard music—soft, ancient, and unfamiliar. He opened his eyes not to darkness, but to a vast plain of glowing grass under a sky with three suns.

A figure approached, cloaked in stardust and smiles.
“Welcome, Eli,” it said. “This is the Between.”

“The Between?” Eli echoed.

“Not quite Heaven. Not Hell either. It’s where questions get answered—if you’re brave enough to ask.”

Eli walked with the figure, memories unfolding around them like tapestries—his childhood laughter, his regrets, the love he never confessed. He felt them, not with sorrow, but with clarity.

“Is this… it?” he asked. “Is this the end?”

The figure shook its head. “No. Just the beginning. You may choose to move on—or return.”

“Return?” Eli blinked. “You mean, be reborn?”

“Not as you were. But with echoes of who you’ve been.”

Eli looked up at the sky where constellations whispered his name. He thought of unfinished dreams, the people he had loved, the lessons half-learned.

“I think… I’d like to try again.”

The figure nodded. “Then remember—kindness weighs more than gold, and love survives death.”

The light grew brighter. Eli stepped into it.

And somewhere, a baby cried its first breath—eyes wide, soul ancient.</p>
