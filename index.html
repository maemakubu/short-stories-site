    <p>Hello and Welcome! How are you? I hope you're doing great! My name is Serame. I'm a 4th year medical student at SMU. I like to write poems and short stories. These works are based on people I've known and experiences I've had.</p>

      <h1>The Great Beyond</h1>
      <p>When Eli took his last breath, he expected silence. Instead, he heard music—soft, ancient, and unfamiliar.</p>
      
      <p>He opened his eyes not to darkness, but to a vast plain of glowing grass under a sky with three suns. A figure approached, cloaked in stardust and smiles. "Welcome, Eli," it said. "This is the Between."</p>
      
      <p>"The Between?" Eli echoed. "Not quite Heaven. Not Hell either. It's where questions get answered—if you're brave enough to ask."</p>
      
      <p>Eli walked with the figure, memories unfolding around them like tapestries—his childhood laughter, his regrets, the love he never confessed. He felt them, not with sorrow, but with clarity.</p>
      
      <p>"Is this... it?" he asked. "Is this the end?"</p>
      
      <p>The figure shook its head. "No. Just the beginning. You may choose to move on—or return."</p>
      
      <p>"Return?" Eli blinked. "You mean, be reborn?"</p>
      
      <p>"Not as you were. But with echoes of who you've been."</p>
      
      <p>Eli looked up at the sky where constellations whispered his name. He thought of unfinished dreams, the people he had loved, the lessons half-learned. "I think... I'd like to try again."</p>
      
      <p>The figure nodded. "Then remember—kindness weighs more than gold, and love survives death."</p>
      
      <p>The light grew brighter. Eli stepped into it. And somewhere, a baby cried its first breath—eyes wide, soul ancient.</p>
